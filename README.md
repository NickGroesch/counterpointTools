# counterpointTools
upstream for development of counterpointTools packages for multiple languages

this is a fork of parts of my bootcamp final project repo at `https://github.com/NickGroesch/Gradus`

I hope to factor out and repackage logic related to contrapuntal analysis, and perhaps publish `npm` and `pip` packages
